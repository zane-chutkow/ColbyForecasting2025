We are using modeling specifically to make habitat suitability maps for select species under two climate scenarios (RCP45 and RCP85) at two different times (2055 and 2075) in the future.\nWe can choose from a number of different models: random forest “rf”, maximum entropy “maxent” or “maxnet”, boosted regression trees “brt”, general linear models “glm”, etc. The point of each is to make a mathematical representation of natural occurrences. It is important to consider what those occurences might be - categorical like labels? likelihoods like probabilities? continuous like measurements? Here are examples of each…\nWe are modeling with known observations (presences) and a sampling of the background, so we are trying to model a likelihood that a species will be encountered (and reported) relative to the environmental conditions. We are looking for a model that can produce relative likelihood of an encounter that results in a report.\nWe’ll be using a random forest model (rf). We were inspired to follow this route by using this tidy models tutorial prepared by our colleague Omi Johnson.",

    "text": "5.1 Modifying the recipe with steps\nSteps are cumulative modifications, and that means the order in which they are added matters. These steps comprise the bulk of pre-processing steps.\nSome modifications are applied row-by-row. For example, rows of the input modeling data that have one or more missing values (NAs) can be problematic and they should be removed.\nOther modifications are to manipulate entire columns. Sometimes the recipes requires subsequent steps before the modeling begins in earnest. For example we know from experience that it is often useful to log scale (base 10) depth when working with biological models. If depth and Xbtm have made it this far, you’ll note that each range over 4 or more orders of magnitude. That’s not a problem by itself, but it can introduce a bias toward larger values whenever the mean is computed. So, we’ll add a step for log scaling these, but only if depth and Xbtm have made it this far (this may vary by species.)\n\nrec = rec |&gt; \n  step_naomit()\nif (\"depth\" %in% cfg$keep_vars){\n  rec = rec |&gt;\n    step_log(depth,  base = 10)\n}\nif (\"Xbtm\" %in% cfg$keep_vars){\n  rec = rec |&gt;\n    step_log(Xbtm,  base = 10)\n}\nrec\n\n\n\n\n── Recipe ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n── Inputs \n\n\nNumber of variables by role\n\n\noutcome:   1\npredictor: 7\n\n\n\n\n\n── Operations \n\n\n• Removing rows with NA values in: &lt;none&gt;\n\n\nNext we state that we want to remove variables that might be highly correlated with other variables. If two variables are highly correlated, they will not provide the modeling system with more information, just redundant information which doesn’t neccessarily help. step_corr() accepts a variety of arguments specifying which variables to test to correlation including some convenience selectors like all_numeric(), all_string() and friends. We want all predictors which happen to all be numeric, so we can use all_predictors() or all_numeric_predictors(). Specificity is better then generality so let’s choose numeric predictors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe have already tested variables for high collinearlity, but here we can add a slightly different filter, high correlation, for the same issue. Since we have dealt with this already we shouldn’t expect that step will change the preprocessing very much.

Most coding is text-based; people writing coding instructions into simple text documents. But some coding is graphical or visual. We shall be using text-based coding. We are going to use a free and open source general programming language called R. R programming language has its roots in statistics and science, but it really can be used for anything.\nIn the early days, coding was pretty barebones - all one needed was a text editor and access to the programming language - no frills there, no pretty images, no buttons to push, just typing. As time passed, volunteers added niceties to the text editor, like visualizing plots of data, buttons to save files, colorized text for the typed code, and other bells and whistles. These editors became know as graphical user interfaces (GUI for short.) GUIs keep getting easier and easier for people to use. We will use the GUI known as RStudio. It’s best to think of GUIs as wrappers around the core programming language; they are really nice and pretty, but they can’t do math. The programming language itself (which does do math!), evolved only as it needed to to fix bugs and make general improvements.",

    "text": "4.2 Spatial data\nSpatial data is any data that has been assigned to a location on a planet (or even between planets!); that means environmental data is mapped to locations on oblate spheroids (like Earth). The oblate spheroid shape presents interesting but challenging math to the data scientist. Modern spatial data is designed to make data science easier by handling all of the location information in a discrete and standardized manner. By discrete we mean that we don’t have to sweat the details.\n\n4.2.1 Point data\nMany spatial data sets come as point data - locations (longitude, latitude and maybe altitude/depth and/or time) with one or more measurements (temperature, cloudiness, probability of precipitation, abundance of fish, population density, etc) attached to that point. Here is an example of point data about long-term oceanographic monitoring buoys in the Gulf of Maine (“gom”). We’ll read the buoy data into a variable, buoy. Next we can print the result simply by typing the name (or you could type print(buoys) if you like all the extra typing.)\n\nbuoys = gom_buoys()\nbuoys\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 3 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -70.4277 ymin: 42.3233 xmax: -65.9267 ymax: 44.10163\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  name  longname            id                geometry\n* &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;POINT [°]&gt;\n1 wms   Western Maine Shelf B01    (-70.4277 43.18065)\n2 cms   Central Maine Shelf E01     (-69.3578 43.7148)\n3 pb    Penobscot Bay       F01   (-68.99689 44.05495)\n4 ems   Eastern Maine Shelf I01   (-68.11359 44.10163)\n5 jb    Jordan Basin        M01   (-67.88029 43.49041)\n6 nec   Northeast Channel   N01     (-65.9267 42.3233)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can get the online documention for functions a couple of ways. You can type ?name_of_function, or or help(name_of_function). Try ?gom_buoys as an example.\nSometimes you need more - like seeing the function itself. You can always try typing the function name without any trailing parentheses.\n\ngom_buoys\n\nfunction (form = c(\"table\", \"sf\")[2]) \n{\n    x = structure(list(name = c(\"wms\", \"cms\", \"pb\", \"ems\", \"jb\", \n        \"nec\"), longname = c(\"Western Maine Shelf\", \"Central Maine Shelf\", \n        \"Penobscot Bay\", \"Eastern Maine Shelf\", \"Jordan Basin\", \n        \"Northeast Channel\"), id = c(\"B01\", \"E01\", \"F01\", \"I01\", \n        \"M01\", \"N01\"), lon = c(-70.4277, -69.3578, -68.99689, \n        -68.11359, -67.88029, -65.9267), lat = c(43.18065, 43.7148, \n        44.05495, 44.10163, 43.49041, 42.3233)), row.names = c(NA, \n        -6L), class = c(\"tbl_df\", \"tbl\", \"data.frame\"))\n    if (tolower(form[1]) == \"sf\") \n        x = sf::st_as_sf(x, coords = c(\"lon\", \"lat\"), crs = 4326)\n    x\n}\n&lt;bytecode: 0x7fb553661b48&gt;\n\n\nIf that still doesn’t work, we highly recommend trying Rseek.org which is an R-language specific search engine.\n\n\nSo there are 6 buoys, each with an attached attribute “name”, “longname” and “id”, as well as the spatial location datain the “geometry” column (just longitude and latitude in this case).

These are great for all sorts of data like satellite images, bathymetry maps and environmental modeling data. We’ll be working with environmental modeling data which we call “Brickman data”. You can learn more about Brickman data in the wiki. We’ll be glossing over the details here, but there’s lots of detail in the wiki.\nWe’ll read in the database that tracks 82 Brickman data files, and then immediately filter out the rows that define the “PRESENT” scenario (where present means 1982–2013) and monthly climatology models.\n\ndb = brickman_database() |&gt;\n  filter(scenario == \"PRESENT\", interval == \"mon\") # note the double '==', it's comparative\ndb\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  scenario year    interval var  \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      MLD  \n2 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      Sbtm \n3 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      SSS  \n4 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      SST  \n5 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      Tbtm \n6 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      U    \n7 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      V    \n8 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      Xbtm \n\n\nIf you are wondering about filtering a table, be sure to check out the wiki on tabular data to get started.\nYou might be wondering what that |&gt; is doing. It is called a pipe, and it delivers the output of one function to the next function as the first parameter (aka argument). For example, brickman_database() produces a table, that table is immediately passed into filter() to choose rows that match our criteria.\nNow that we have the database listing just the records we want, we pass it to the read_brickman() function.\n\ncurrent = read_brickman(db)\ncurrent\n\nstars object with 3 dimensions and 9 attributes\nattribute(s):\n                Min.      1st Qu.

    "text": "4.4 Array data (aka raster data)\nOften spatial data comes in grids, like regular arrays of pixels. These are great for all sorts of data like satellite images, bathymetry maps and environmental modeling data. We’ll be working with environmental modeling data which we call “Brickman data”. You can learn more about Brickman data in the wiki. We’ll be glossing over the details here, but there’s lots of detail in the wiki.\nWe’ll read in the database that tracks 82 Brickman data files, and then immediately filter out the rows that define the “PRESENT” scenario (where present means 1982–2013) and monthly climatology models.\n\ndb = brickman_database() |&gt;\n  filter(scenario == \"PRESENT\", interval == \"mon\") # note the double '==', it's comparative\ndb\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  scenario year    interval var  \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      MLD  \n2 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      Sbtm \n3 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      SSS  \n4 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      SST  \n5 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      Tbtm \n6 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      U    \n7 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      V    \n8 PRESENT  PRESENT mon      Xbtm \n\n\nIf you are wondering about filtering a table, be sure to check out the wiki on tabular data to get started.\nYou might be wondering what that |&gt; is doing. It is called a pipe, and it delivers the output of one function to the next function as the first parameter (aka argument). For example, brickman_database() produces a table, that table is immediately passed into filter() to choose rows that match our criteria.\nNow that we have the database listing just the records we want, we pass it to the read_brickman() function.\n\ncurrent = read_brickman(db)\ncurrent\n\nstars object with 3 dimensions and 9 attributes\nattribute(s):\n                Min.      1st Qu.

    "text": "2.5 Saving a file to keep track of modeling choices\nYou may have noticed that we write a lot of things to files (aka, “writing to disk”). It’s a useful practice especially when working with a multi-step process. One particular file, a configuration file, is used frequently in data science to store information about the choices we make as we work through our project. Configuration files generally are simple text files that we can easily get the computer to read and write.\nIn R, a confguration is treated as a named list. Each element of a list is named, but beyond that there aren’t any particular rules about confugurations. You can learn more about configurations in this tutorial.\nLet’s make a confuguration list that holds 4 items: version identifier, species name, sampling approach and the names of the variables to model with.\n\ncfg = list(\n  version = \"g_Aug\",               # g for greedy!\n  scientificname = \"Mola mola\",\n  approach = \"greedy\",\n  mon = \"Aug\",\n  keep_vars =  keep)\n\nWe can access by name three ways using what is called “indexing” : using the [[ indexing brackets, using the $ indexing operator or using the getElement() function.\n\ncfg[['scientificname']]\n\n[1] \"Mola mola\"\n\ncfg[[2]]\n\n[1] \"Mola mola\"\n\ncfg$scientificname\n\n[1] \"Mola mola\"\n\ngetElement(cfg, \"scientificname\")\n\n[1] \"Mola mola\"\n\ngetElement(cfg, 2)\n\n[1] \"Mola mola\"\n\n\nNow we’ll write this list to a file. First let’s set up a pathwy where we might store these configurations, and for that matter, to store our modeling files. We’ll make a new directory, models/g008 and write the configuration there. We’ll use the famous “YAML” format to store the file. See the file functions/configuration.R for documentation on reading and writing.\n\nok = make_path(data_path(\"models\")) # make a directory for models\nwrite_configuration(cfg)            \n\nUse the Files pane to navigate to your personal data directory. Open the g_Aug.yaml file - this is what you configuration looks like in YAML. Fortunately we don’t mess manually with these much.",
